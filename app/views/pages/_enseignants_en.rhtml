<h1>International teaching and research</h1>
<%= image_tag "Erasmus-logo2.jpg", :class => "right" %>
<p>The Department of History attaches great importance to international cooperation in both its teaching and research. We endeavour to develop cooperative exchanges between teaching and research staff both in fields where our department possesses a strong research expertise – Caribbean History and Archaeology for instance – and in fields where complementary synergies in research specialisation can be exploited.</p>
<p>The Socrates Teaching Staff Mobility programme is for us an opportunity to invite European colleagues to communicate their research at the UAG, offering our students and us a different view on familiar historical problems and debates, or, indeed, introduce us to fields of historical research which are not represented in our  department. For our department, situated in a relatively small university with weak internal funding, the European Union financed programmes are a unique opportunity to communicate our research to an international audience and to invite lecturers who can contribute to the variety of our teaching programme. Finally, teaching staff exchanges are also a prime opportunity to promote our department to students abroad, giving general information on the UAG and presenting our undergraduate and graduate courses to potential candidates from abroad.</p>

<h2>Teaching staff mobility between the Department of History and its partners</h2>

<p>Currently contracts for staff mobility are in place with universities in Belgium (<a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-index.html" title="UCL - Universit&eacute; catholique de Louvain">UC Louvain</a>), Britain (<a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/" title="Untitled Document">University of Wales Bangor</a> and <a href="http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/" title="Welcome to London Metropolitan University">London Metropolitan University</a>), Bulgaria (<a href="http://www.uni-plovdiv.bg/?ln=2" title="University of plovdiv &quot;Paisii Hilendarski&quot;">Plovdiv University Paisii Hilendarski</a>), Germany (<a href="http://www.uni-bamberg.de/" title="Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg: Startseite">University of Bamberg</a>, <a href="http://www.ph-karlsruhe.de">University of Education Karlsruhe</a> and <a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de">Siegen University</a>), Romania ("<a href="http://www.ugal.ro/" title="Dunarea de Jos University Galati">Dunărea de Jos" University Galaţi</a>), Spain (<a href="http://www.ulpgc.es/index.php?idioma=en" title="ULPGC - Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria">University of Las Palmas Gran Canaria</a> and <a href="http://www.udl.cat/perfils/visitors.html" title="Internacional">University of Lleida</a>) and Portugal (<a href="http://www.uc.pt" title="Universidade de Coimbra">University of Coimbra</a>).</p>
<p>In 2006/7 our department has had the pleasure of receiving Dr Valentin Petroussenko of Plovdiv University who has given presentations not only on contemporary Balkan history, but also on the specific problems of peripheral regions in the European Union. In outgoing mobility our department has sent lecturers to Bulgaria and Romania thus reinforcing cooperation between departments and “putting the UAG on the map”. It is our sincere hope that staff exchanges will continue to intensify thus binding our department and our students more strongly into a network of cutting edge research.</p>

<h2>Visiting lecturers and researchers</h2>
<p>We would like to extend a warm invitation to all historians – and academic staff in closely related fields – at our partner departments to come to Martinique and Guadeloupe to meet our students and the academic community in and around the UAG. We will do our best to help you with administrative preparations (invitations and such), assist you in finding moderately priced accommodation (for example at the <a href="http://www.afpa-martinique.fr/centre.php?Id=4" title="Afpa - Martinique -  Centre De Formation">AFPA</a>, five minutes by bus from our Schœlcher campus) and generally assure not only a satisfactory organisation of your teaching programme, but also opportunities to meet members of the department and visits allowing you to get to know our islands. Academic visitors should take into account that our teaching terms are relatively short, September to early December and February to early May. If you would like to come outside teaching terms you will still be very welcome and certainly will find an audience for public lectures, but your academic programme cannot include participation in our regular courses.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact our Socrates coordinator (<%= link_to "Hartmut Ziche", enseignant_path(:id => enseignant_by_name("Ziche"))%>) to plan and prepare a teaching and research trip to the Antilles.</p>
